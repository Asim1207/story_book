Comprehensive Customization: Providing extensive options for editing text, re-generating specific illustrations, choosing art styles, and personalizing characters beyond simple prompts, empowering users with creative control.
Seamless Print-Ready PDF Export: Guaranteeing high-resolution PDF output optimized for professional printing, directly addressing the technical limitation of low-resolution AI images, and supporting robust font embedding and image compression.
Ethical Framework: Transparent policies regarding AI training data, user data privacy (especially for children), and rigorous content moderation to prevent inappropriate generations, fostering trust and safety.
